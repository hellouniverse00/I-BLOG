                <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.smoFSoxugNrlYP9dboDPjwHaEK?w=329&h=185&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="">

                "Public companies rely on the market to raise capital, and look to their stock price for information about what investors believe about their business and prospects," Ronan says. Meanwhile, investors "rely on the market for investment opportunities" to allocate their capital.
                <br>
                <br>
                "The idea of a stock market is to align the interests of the entire trading ecosystem – from public companies to investors to brokers to exchanges," he says. "Ideally, stock markets allow the investing public to participate in the growth and development of enterprises engaged in all the different sectors of the economy."
                <br>
                <br>
                For investors, the stock market works like an auction where buyers place bids and sellers offer asking prices for shares of stock. When the bid equals the ask, a trade occurs.
                <br>
                <br>
                The difference between what buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to accept is called the bid-ask spread. A smaller bid-ask spread indicates a more liquid, or easily traded, security.
                <br>
                <br>
                A stock's price represents what the cumulative market of buyers and sellers consider its value to be. As with everything in the economy, it's largely dictated by supply and demand. When there are more sellers trying to offload their stock than buyers interested in purchasing, the price falls. If prices on all or most stocks drop significantly and suddenly, a stock market crash occurs.
                <br>
                <br>
                "A stock market crash is a large percentage decline in the overall market in a very short period of time," Kass says. "For example, on Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 22.6% in one day. That was the largest one-day percentage decline in many decades."
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the stock market averages 9% to 10% annual returns, investors can't forget that stocks are risky. "They could decline by as much as 30% or more in a single year," Kass says.
<br>
<br>
                <b><i>How does investing in stock market work</i></b>
<br>
<br>
                A stock represents a share of ownership in a publicly traded company. If you own a share of Apple (ticker: AAPL), you have an ownership stake in Apple. This grants you the right to vote on Apple's corporate policy and a claim to a portion of its profits.
              <br>
              <br>
                Investors typically buy stock in a company in the hopes that the share price will increase over time, as noted in the "buy low, sell high" axiom. But share price appreciation isn't the only way to make money in the stock market.

            <div class="mb-1 text-muted">16 september</div>
            <p class="mb-auto para"><strong>

                <b><i>diagram of a jet engine </i></b>

                <img src="https://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/how-jet-engine-works.jpg" alt="">
                
                <br>
<br>                

               1. For a jet going slower than the speed of sound, the engine is moving through the air at about 1000 km/h (600 mph). We can think of the engine as being stationary and the cold air moving toward it at this speed.
               <br>
               <br>
               2. A fan at the front sucks the cold air into the engine and forces it through the inlet. This slows the air down by about 60percent and its speed is now about 400 km/h (240 mph).
               <br>
               <br>
                3. A second fan called a compressor squeezes the air (increases 
                its pressure) by about eight times, and this dramatically increases its temperature.
                <br>
                <br>
              4.  Kerosene (liquid fuel) is squirted into the engine from a fuel tank in the plane's wing.
              <br>
              <br>
               5. In the combustion chamber, just behind the compressor, the kerosene mixes with the compressed air and burns fiercely, giving off hot exhaust gases and producing a huge increase in temperature. The burning mixture reaches a temperature of around 900°C (1650°F).
               <br>
               <br>
              6.  The exhaust gases rush past a set of turbine blades, spinning them like a windmill. Since the turbine gains energy, the gases must lose the same amount of energy—and they do so by cooling down slightly and losing pressure.
              <br>
              <br>
                7.The turbine blades are connected to a long axle (represented by the middle gray line) that runs the length of the engine. 
                The compressor and the fan are also connected to this axle. So, as the turbine blades spin, they also turn the compressor and the fan.
                <br>
                <br>
               8. The hot exhaust gases exit the engine through a tapering exhaust nozzle. Just as water squeezed through a narrow pipe accelerates dramatically into a fast jet (think of what happens in a water pistol), the tapering design of the exhaust nozzle helps to accelerate the gases to a speed of over 2100 km/h (1300 mph). So the hot air leaving the engine at the back is traveling over twice the speed of the cold air entering it at the front—and that's what powers the plane. Military jets often have an after burner that squirts fuel into the exhaust jet to produce extra thrust. The backward-moving exhaust gases power the jet forward. Because the plane is much bigger and heavier than the exhaust gases it produces, the exhaust gases have to zoom backward much faster than the plane's own speed.
               <br>
               <br>
               <b><i> In brief, you can see that each main part of the engine does a different thing to the air or fuel mixture passing through:</i></b>
               <br>
                
              1. Compressor: Dramatically increases the pressure of the air (and, to a lesser extent) its temperature.
              <br>
              <br>
              2.  Combustion chamber: Dramatically increases the temperature of the air-fuel mixture by releasing heat energy from the fuel.
              <br>
              <br>
              3.  Exhaust nozzle: Dramatically increases the velocity of the exhaust gases, so powering the plane.

              <br>
              <br>
                What do jet engines look like in reality?
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="https://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/jet-engine-globemaster.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                
                A lot more complicated than my little picture! Here's a typical example of a large, real turbofan engine, opened up and undergoing maintenance. I've labelled eight major parts in my explanation above; as you can see here, a real jet engine has a good few thousand!

          <div class="mb-1 text-muted">16 september </div>
          <p class="card-text mb-auto para"><strong>

           <b><i> How does a hydrogen bomb work? </i></b>
            
            Mankind had never seen anything like it. When it was unleashed on people in an effort to stop a war, all people saw was a blinding light, followed by complete darkness and destruction.

            <br>
            <br>

            It was August 6th 1945. It was the most powerful weapon ever created by mankind. It’s shock wave turned everything in a 1 mile radius to rubble.
           
            It unleashed energy and radiation that killed 140,000 people in the industrial city of Hiroshima Japan.
 
            As powerful as this bomb was, mankind has since invented a weapon that Is hundreds of times more powerful.
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, we have thermonuclear weapons, also called the hydrogen bomb. To give you an idea of its power, if the original Hiroshima bomb was dropped in New York City, heaven forbid, it would destroy everything in a 1 mile radius.
            
            If a hydrogen bomb was dropped there, heaven forbid, it would not just destroy everything in a one mile radius, It would make into rubble everything in an 8 mile in radius. This would be a total calamity.
            <br><br>
            The world now has over 10,000 such bombs, capable of easily destroying every single person on our planet, many times over.
            <br>
            <br>
          <b><i>  

            What makes these weapons so powerful?
             How do they actually work?</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The bomb on Hiroshima released the energy equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT. The first hydrogen bomb released the energy equivalent of 10,000,000 tons of TNT.
            
            While the atomic bomb like the one that was dropped on Hirsoshima worked on the principle of releasing energy through the splitting of atoms – also called fission, See my video on that. — a hydrogen bomb does something that releases even more energy, and that is it fuses atoms together.

             <b><i>fusion vs fission</i></b>
            
            Fusion is even more powerful than fission. It is the same process that powers our sun.
            
            And when fission is combined with fusion in a hydrogen bomb, it creates energy orders of magnitude higher than fission alone, making hydrogen bombs 100’s to 1000’s of times more powerful than atomic bombs.
            
            <br>
            <br>
         <b><i>   How does fusion work?</i></b>
            
         <br>
         <br>
            The fusion portion of the bomb creates energy by combining two isotopes of hydrogen called deuterium and Tritium to create helium.
            
            Unlike a natural hydrogen atom that is made of one electron orbiting around a proton, these isotopes have extra neutrons in their nuclei.
            
            A large amount of energy is released when these two isotopes fuse together to form helium because a helium atom has much less energy than these two isotopes combined. This excess energy is released.
            
            One of the main problems with creating the Hydrogen bomb was obtaining the tritium. Scientists found that they could generate this on-the-spot inside the hydrogen bomb with a compound combining lithium and deuterium. The result was a dry, solid, stable powder called Lithium-deuteride. So this is what most hydrogen bombs today use as their fuel today.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>But how does the process of fusion actually occur?</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Ordinarily the nuclei of two atoms cannot be combined because these nuclei have strong positive electrical charges and repel each other.
            
            This is why scientists chose hydrogen as the best candidate for fusion because it has only one proton, and thus would have less electrical charge than atoms with multiple protons in their nuclei.
            
            But if the nuclei repel each other, how do they fuse? It turns out that if you increase the temperature by millions of degrees, it is possible to combine nuclei together.
            
            As the temperature increases, the atoms speed up. But an extraordinary increase in speed of the atoms is needed in order to give them a chance to overcome their natural repulsion.
            
            The temperatures needed are astronomical – higher than even that at the center of the sun – 100 million degrees celcius. (Center of sun is 15 million degrees) At this temperature, the isotopes become a form of matter called plasma.
            
            This is when the electrons orbiting the nuclei is stripped away from the nucleus and the nuclei and electrons are floating around freely in a kind of high temperature soup.
            
            At this temperature, the nuclei can get very close to each other – and when they get as close as 1X10^-15 meters apart, then the strong nuclear strong force which is present only at very close distances and is responsible for keeping protons and neutrons glued together, takes over and binds the protons and neutrons together to form a helium nucleus and a free neutron.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>So how is a temperature of 100 million degrees achieved?</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is where the fission or atomic bomb inside the hydrogen bomb enclosure comes in.
            
            The purpose of the fission bomb is to provide the energy needed to heat up the fusion reaction to this 100 million of degrees.
            <br>
            <br>
      <b><i>      So how do they work together?</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            A hydrogen bomb is actually three bombs in one. It contains an ordinary chemical bomb, a fission bomb like the one dropped on Nagasaki, and a fusion bomb.
            
            All three work in concert. The chemical bomb initiates the fission bomb which initiates the fusion bomb.
            
            To understand how the fission and fusion bombs work together, it is important to understand how the bomb is put together.
            
            In a ballistic missile, the bomb is usually located at the top, inside the cone portion of the missile. Here is where the hydrogen bomb vessel sits.
            
            The casing of the bomb is lined with beryllium, this acts as a mirror to reflect the neutrons back into the casing rather than allowing them to escape the vessel.
            
            A small atomic bomb is located at the top of the casing. It is shaped like a sphere. The top of the sphere contains conventional chemical explosives surrounding a sphere of beryllium mirror casing, inside of which is a smaller uranium or plutonium sphere about 4 to 6 inches in diameter.
            
            Below this atomic bomb is the hydrogen or fusion bomb. It consists of a cylinder made of uranium, the fuel for the fusion reaction, lithium deuteride sits inside the cylinder. And at the core of this cylinder sits a rod of plutonium.
            
            In between the fission and fusion bomb is an encasing made of Styrofoam.

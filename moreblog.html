                        <div class="mb-1 text-muted">12 september </div>
                        <p class="card-text mb-auto">Animation is a simulation of movement created by a series of
                            illustrations or photographs displayed in rapid succession. Whereas videography takes
                            continuous motion and breaks it up into discrete frames, animation starts with independent
                            pictures and puts them together to form the illusion of continuous motion.

                            Video games are by definition an animated medium, and animation is considered a genre of
                            film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The first Academy Award for Best
                            Animated Feature was awarded in 2002 to the creators of Shrek (2001), a DreamWorks Animation
                            production that rivaled Disney-Pixar’s Monster’s Inc. (2001).

                            <b><i>TYPES OF ANIMATION</i></b><br>

                            There are many subtypes of animation styles, but the main categories include:

                            Flipbook-style animation is thought to be the earliest form, with historians dating the
                            phenakistoscope (a rotating disc with images that creates an animation loop when spun) back
                            to the 1830s.
                            Stop motion animation uses a series of photographs (as opposed to illustrations) to generate
                            the movement effect. Claymation which uses clay figurines as the subject is a type of stop
                            motion animation that has created some popular feature length films, including the Wallace
                            and Gromit franchise, The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), and Coraline (2009).
                            2D animation is created using either traditional illustration tools like drawing pencils and
                            paper or computer applications like Adobe Animate and Toon Boom Harmony. Although it is
                            still sometimes used today, 2D animation is most commonly found in cartoons made before the
                            2000s, such as Aladdin (1992), Charlotte s Web (1973), and Spongebob Squarepants (1999- ).

                            <b>3d and 2d animation</b><br>


                            3D animation adds depth to a 2D animation to make it appear as if it exists in the real
                            world. A prominent form of 3D animation is computer-generated imagery (CGI), which uses
                            chroma-key technology to apply 3D graphics to existing video footage.
                            Motion graphics are animations that don t hold any narrative meaning. They do not tell a
                            story independently, but they are commonly used in marketing materials as a way of
                            presenting text information in a visually dynamic way. Examples of motion graphics include
                            transitions between slides of a presentation, title sequences in film and television, or a
                            logo that animates when opening a mobile app.

                        <p class="mb-auto">Artificial Intelligence is by far one of the most fascinating and astounding
                            creations ever made in the history of mankind. With the advent of its invention, there is
                            still a large domain that is yet to be explored. In fact, its real-world application to date
                            is probably the tip of the iceberg. In the past few years, there has been rapid growth in
                            the domain of AI, making it one of the most lucrative industries.

                            <b><i>Introduction to AI</i></b>
                            In Layman terms, Artificial Intelligence can be used defined as a branch of computer science
                            that can simulate human intelligence. AI is implemented in machines to perform tasks that
                            actually require human intelligence. If you are wondering, what is ai? Some of their primary
                            function includes the like of reasoning, learning, problem-solving and quick decision
                            making.

                            At the core of it, Artificial Intelligence is nothing but algorithms with certain sets of
                            rules. AI systems have the ability to learn from the iteration of tasks where the computer
                            data (aka machine learning algorithms) are fed to the system. This is exactly how, machine
                            learning can actually get better at doing their specified tasks, without any external
                            interference.

                            Different Types of Artificial Intelligence
                            Artificial Intelligence can be further classified based on its complexity to replicate human
                            intelligence. These characteristics refer to their real-world usage, along with the
                            technology involved. This breaks down AI into real and hypothetical systems. The Different
                            types of AI are as follows:

                            <b><i>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</i></b>
                            Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) also commonly known as Narrow AI or Weak AI is the only
                            realistic AI human has achieved so far. This particular approach towards AI is goal-oriented
                            and can perform only designated tasks. Some of the examples of Narrow AI include face
                            recognition, voice assistant, and everything similar that can perform only specified tasks.

                            From the outside, these machines might seem intelligent, but their operation is always under
                            certain constraints and bounding. This is only of the primary reasons, they are termed as
                            Weak AI. Instead of replicating human intelligence, Narrow AI is best suited for simulation
                            with constrained parameters.

                            <b><i>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</i></b>

                            Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is a completely hypothetical situation where machines can
                            become completely self-aware, even surpassing the likes of human intelligence. As of now,
                            Superintelligence only exists in dystopian science fiction.

                            The idea of Artificial Superintelligence is that at a certain point in time it can actually
                            understand human intelligence while experiencing the time. They would create their own
                            belief system with their own ideology.

                            computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that
                            humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
                            Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the
                            use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions,
                            and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive
                            decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As
                            big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase.
                            They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions and the data to

                            speaker to the automated system on a local utility company's call center, voice recognition
                            is critical. It reduces friction for users and even increases accessibility to a wider

                            When the little chat box pops up next time you're shopping online, the "person" who answers
                            might not be a person at all. Many companies have switched to using chatbots that deploy
                            conversational AI to answer customers' questions. These AI use machine learning to improve
                            their understanding of customers' responses and answers. Whether the input is voice or text,
                            Machine Learning Engineers have plenty of work to improve bot conversations for companies
                            worldwide.

                            This one probably comes as no surprise. People talk about "the algorithm" all the time.

                            Think about all the data captured on your social media account — what you like, the posts
                            you engage with, the times of day you're most active, what ads you'll click on, and more.
                            Machine-learning algorithms use all that information to customize your social media feeds
                            and better market to you.

                        </h5>


                        WW 1 was fought between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers.
                        The main members of the Allied Powers were France, Russia, and Britain. The United States also
                        fought on the side of the Allies after 1917.
                        The main members of the Central Powers were Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and
                        Bulgaria.
                        <br>

                        <h5><b><i>cause of the war</i></b></h5>


                        There was no single event that led to World War I. The war happened because of several different
                        events that took place in the years building up to 1914.

                        The new international expansionist policy of Germany: In 1890 the new emperor of Germany,
                        Wilhelm II, began an international policy that sought to turn his country into a world power.
                        Germany was seen as a threat by the other powers and destabilized the international situation.
                        Mutual Defense Alliances: Countries throughout Europe made mutual defence agreements. These
                        treaties meant that if one country was attacked, allied countries were bound to defend them.
                        The Triple Alliance-1882 linking Germany with Austria-Hungary and Italy.
                        The Triple Entente, which was made up of Britain, France, and Russia, concluded by 1907.
                        Thus, there were two rival groups in Europe.

                        <b><i>Imperialism:</i></b> Before World War I, Africa and parts of Asia were points of
                        contention among the
                        European countries because of their raw materials. The increasing competition and desire for
                        greater empires led to an increase in the confrontation that helped push the world into World
                        War I.
                        <b><i>Militarism:</i></b> As the world entered the 20th century, an arms race had begun. By
                        1914, Germany had
                        the greatest increase in military buildup. Great Britain and Germany both greatly increased
                        their navies in this time period. This increase in militarism helped push the countries involved
                        into war.
                        <b><i> Nationalism:</i></b> Much of the origin of the war was based on the desire of the Slavic
                        peoples in
                        Bosnia and Herzegovina to no longer be part of Austria Hungary but instead be part of Serbia. In
                        this way, nationalism led to the War.
                        Assassination of Archduke Franz <b><i>Ferdinand:</i></b> In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
                        the heir to
                        the throne of Austria-Hungary, was shot while he was visiting Sarajevo in Bosnia. He was killed
                        by a Serbian person, who thought that Serbia should control Bosnia instead of Austria. Because
                        its leader had been shot, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. As a result:
                        Russia got involved as it had an alliance with Serbia.
                        Germany then declared war on Russia because Germany had an alliance with Austria-Hungary.
                        Britain declared war on Germany because of its invasion of neutral Belgium - Britain had
                        agreements to protect both Belgium and France.
                        <br>
                        <b><i>battles during the war</i></b>
                        Some of the major battles during the war included the First Battle of the Marne, Battle of the
                        Somme, Battle of Tannenberg, Battle of Gallipoli, and the Battle of Verdun.

                        <h5><b><i>Introduction</i></b></h5>

                        World War II, also called Second World War, was a conflict that involved virtually every part of
                        the world during the years 1939–45.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4><b><i>Axis vs allies </i></b></h4>
                        The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France,
                        Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China.

                        <h5><b><i>Deaths during second world war</i></b></h5>
                        It was the biggest conflict in history that had lasted almost six years.

                        Nearly some 100 million people had been militarised, and 50 million had been killed (around 3%
                        of the world's population).

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <h5><b><i>Cause of the war</i></b></h5>
                        The major causes of World War II were numerous. They include the impact of the Treaty of
                        Versailles following WWI, the worldwide economic depression, failure of appeasement, the rise of
                        militarism in Germany and Japan, and the failure of the League of Nations.
<br>
<br>
                     <h5>   <b><i>Treaty of Versailles</i></b></h5>

                        Following World War I, the victorious Allied Powers met to decide Germany’s future. Germany was
                        forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles.
                        Under this treaty, Germany had to accept guilt for the war and to pay reparations. Germany lost
                        territory and was prohibited from having a large military.
                        The humiliation faced by Germany under this treaty, paved the way for the spread of
                        Ultra-Nationalism in Germany.
                        Failure of the League of Nations

                        The League of Nations was an international organization set up in 1919 to keep world peace.
                        It was intended that all countries would be members and that if there were disputes between
                        countries, they could be settled by negotiation rather than by force.
                        The League of Nations was a good idea, but ultimately a failure, as not all countries joined the
                        league.
                        Also, the League had no army to prevent military aggression such as Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia
                        in Africa or Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in China.
                        Great Depression of 1929

                        The worldwide economic depression of the 1930s took its toll in different ways in Europe and
                        Asia.
                        In Europe, political power shifted to totalitarian and imperialist governments in several
                        countries, including Germany, Italy, and Spain.
                        In Asia, a resource-starved Japan began to expand aggressively, invading China and maneuvering
                        to control a sphere of influence in the Pacific.
                        Rise of Fascism

                        Victors. stated aims in World War I had been “to make the world safe for democracy,” and postwar
                        Germany was made to adopt a democratic constitution, as did most of the other states restored or
                        created after the war.
                        In the 1920s, however, the wave of nationalistic, militaristic totalitarianism known by its
                        Italian name, fascism.
                        It promised to minister to peoples’ wants more effectively than democracy and presented itself
                        as the one sure defense against communism.
                        Benito Mussolini established the first Fascist, European dictatorship during the interwar period
                        in Italy in 1922.
                        Rise of Nazism

                        Adolf Hitler, the Leader of the German National Socialist (Nazi) party, preached a racist brand
                        of fascism.
                        Hitler promised to overturn the Versailles Treaty, restore German wealth & glory and secure
                        additional Lebensraum (“living space”) for the German people, who he contended deserve more as
                        members of a superior race.
                        In 1933 Hitler became the German Chancellor, and in a series of subsequent moves established
                        himself as dictator.
                        Moreover, in 1941 the Nazi regime unleashed a war of extermination against Slavs, Jews, and
                        other elements deemed inferior by Hitler’s ideology.
                        Policy of Appeasement

                        Hitler openly denounced the Treaty of Versailles and began secretly building up Germany’s army
                        and weapons.
                        Although Britain and France knew of Hitler’s actions, they thought a stronger Germany would stop
                        the spread of Communism from Russia.

                            <h5><b><i>Introduction</i></b></h5>
                            
India has never waged a war against any nation by itself. But it is a country which has always fought for its rights and Independence since the Mughals and the Britishers. India had fought some fierce battle bravely in the past and one among those is the Sino-China War.

The Sino-India war, better known as the Indo-China war was a battle that took place between India and China from October 20 to November 21 in 1962. India never anticipated that China could wage a war but China proved it wrong when it launched an attack on India on October 20, 1962. India was not prepared for the war and as a result, 10,000-20,000 Indian soldiers had to clash against the mighty Chinese troops of 80,000. The thing which is even more perplexing is that the Chinese attacked despite India’s continuous effort to cooperate with China in the external affairs and maintain friendly relations between the two Asian giants. Noticeably, India that time had just thrown off the colonial masters and this is why it did not want a war at that time.
<br>
<br>
<h5><b><i>
    WHAT IS AKSAI CHIN? </i></b></h5>          
Aksai Chin is the southwestward extension of the Tibetan plateau. It is one of the two large disputed border areas between India and China. India claims Aksai Chin as the easternmost part of the union territory of Ladakh whereas china claims that Aksai Chin is the part of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet. Aksai Chin is almost the size of Bhutan and a little smaller than Switzerland. It has been the subject of dispute between India and China since the war in 1962. China had occupied most of the parts of Aksai Chin after the conflict of 1962 and consolidated its military grip over the area, rejecting all the attempts by India to settle border dispute peacefully.
<br>
<br>
<h5> <b><i> 
    WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE WAR?</i></b>
</h5>
At the end of the war, China emerged victoriously and retained control of about 38,000 square kilometres of the territory in Aksai Chin and ever since the area remained a point of contention between the two Asian nations. The military of China further believed that they were successful in the war as they achieved China’s policy objectives of securing borders in its western region of Aksai Chin.
<br>
<br>
<h5><b><i>
    WHY INDIA LOST THE BATTLE?</i></b></h5>
If we analyze India’s defeat in the 1962 Sino-India War, we find it obvious as there were several reasons for this loss.
India never expected an attack from China at that point of time simply because it never intended to wage a war against the Chinese and believed in maintaining a cordial relation and healthy diplomacy with China. Believing this, India deployed only two divisions of troops in the region of the conflict, while the Chinese troops had three regiments positioned over there.
Due to the sudden attack from the Chinese troops, India was ill-prepared for the war. This resulted in the standoff between 10,000-20,000 Indian soldiers and 80,000 Chinese troops.
The Chinese cut Indian telephone lines which didn’t allow India to contact with their headquarters.
India didn’t get any help from western superpower countries like U.S.A, U.K and hence was left alone to fight the battle.
India could not put its forces swiftly to the battleground due to poor military infrastructure.

                        <p class="mb-auto">The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military confrontation between India and Pakistan that occurred during the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan from 3 December 1971 until the Pakistani capitulation in Dhaka on 16 December 1971. The war began with Pakistan's Operation Chengiz Khan which was preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations, which led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and Indian entry into the war for independence in East Pakistan on the side of Bengali nationalist forces, expanding the existing conflict with Indian and Pakistani forces engaging on both eastern and western fronts. 13 days after the war started, India achieved a clear upper hand, the Eastern Command of the Pakistan military signed the instrument of surrender on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh. Approximately 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army, which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan.[45][46] The remaining 10,324 to 12,500 prisoners were civilians, either family members of the military personnel or collaborators (Razakars).<br>
                            <br>
                       

                            It is estimated that members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias killed between 300,000 and 3,000,000 civilians in Bangladesh.[50][51][52][53][54] As a result of the conflict, a further eight to ten million people fled the country to seek refuge in India.[55]

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            During the 1971 Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias called the Razakars raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.

As the Indian Army tightened its grip in East Pakistan, the Indian Air Force continued with its attacks against Pakistan as the campaign developed into a series of daylight anti-airfield, anti-radar, and close-support attacks by fighter jets, with night attacks against airfields and strategic targets by Canberras and An-12s, while Pakistan responded with similar night attacks with its B-57s and C-130s.[12]: 107–108 
<br>
<br>


One of the most successful air raids by India into West Pakistan happened on 8 December 1971, when Indian Hunter aircraft from the Pathankot-based 20 Squadron, attacked the Pakistani base in Murid and destroyed 5 F-86 aircraft on the ground. This was confirmed by Pakistan's military historian, Air Commodore M Kaiser Tufail, in his book In The Ring and on Its Feet: Pakistan Air Force in the 1971 Indo-Pak War.
<br>
<br>


India flew 1,978 sorties in the East and about 4,000 in Pakistan, while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840 at the respective fronts.: 107  More than 80 percent of IAF sorties were close-support and interdiction and about 45 IAF aircraft were lost.
<br>
<br>
Pakistan lost 60 to 75 aircraft, not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors.[24] The imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF's considerably higher sortie rate and its emphasis on ground-attack missions.
